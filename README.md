Assalamualaikum and Greetings,

These are the Git Repo on handing over my implementation work on solving the question 2 from Technical Assessment provided by Regov Technologies Sdn.Bhd. for Software Engineering Internship opportunities.

I've attached the Python file and together with the screenshot of database creation on working on with the code. So here's my detailed explanation on my work :

1) On the first part, I've import the important libraries that I choose to use in solving this question which is from 'Flask' libraries.

2) I've initialize the flask by using '__name__' variable that provided by Python and I've connect the flask configuration with MySQL Database details.

3) Starting from here, I continue by creating the API Endpoints for three of the function which are register, login, and logout by using method POST. As in for the register page, I've add on the form to get username and the password, continued with the query to send into the MySQL DB and commit. Same goes for the login page, requesting form for username and password, proceed with SQL query and fetch data.
 
4) The last part is on running the flask itself. 

This is quite a good experience for me on handling the technical question from your side, however I only manage to complete the second question only because with my background, I only do familiar with Python and MySQL to solve the problem. After all thank you for reading out my work overhere and giving me chances to try new things out !
